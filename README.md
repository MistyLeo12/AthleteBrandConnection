# AthleteBrandConnection

## About
Historically, College Athletes have not been able to monetize off of their own name and hardwork. Meanwhile, schools and media companies make billions off of an industry created from young unpaid athletic talent. We want to create a platform that enables College Athletes to create and monetize their own personal brands. They can do this by posting content into tier lists like kickstarter and depending on how much a consumer  gives will  determine what kind of content from the athlete they get (tutorial videos, autographs, shoutouts, etc.). Athletes can also give freebies and don’t have to charge for certain things if they don’t want to. The freebies could be seen as a way to provide awareness to their name and gather a following.
	
This idea came about after the decision by the NCAA to allow athletes to monetize off of their brands. The NCAA has mandated that all three divisions must create new rules no later than January of 2021. Although this rule won’t go into effect by the end of the semester, we thought that being proactive and getting on top of the idea now would allow for it to be prepared for when the ruling does go into effect. It would be a simple method for athletes of all “tiers” to make some income off of their hard work on the field or court. From the consumer side, they will be able to have a streamlined method to follow their favorite athletes, potentially view stats, and purchase content from the pages. 


This will be a platform with three types of  users--athletes, brands, and consumers (normal users).


## Future
In the future, we want to expand to allow brands to be included on the platform. This would function as a unique type of user where they could connect with athletes for endorsement deals or anything else. As big name brands likely have their own methods to connect with athletes, we potentially envisioned this for lower level athletes and smaller brands. One example could be a local pizza store getting their locally famous college athlete to advertise their pizza!




## Potential Problems

A potential problem that may occur with the app is that brands will only reach out to the top athletes. However, a way to avoid that is by introducing the concept of tiers. The method for determining how players and brands will be ranked is undecided, but the concept is that brands will see players that have been determined to be of a similar level of popularity to them in terms of followers, influence, and white division school they are  at. This will encourage the linking up of brands with all types of athletes. Another potential problem is that athletes may get bombarded with fake requests from fans or bots. While we are currently merely trying to serve as a platform to allow for this connection, this problem could be alleviated by providing a rigorous authentication process as well as giving each athlete a “feedback rating”. This would encourage athletes to follow through on their requests if they hope to take part in more.
